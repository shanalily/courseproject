Since my idea involved reviewing resources, I looked at yelp since I feel like I can effectively find what I want and they use ratings to filter results, even though it is a very different sort of website because results rely on location. Yelp has links to a lot of the source code they use [here](https://yelp.github.io/) and I thought would be interesting to look at that.
